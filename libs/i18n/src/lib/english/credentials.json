    "description": [
      "Back in 2021, I ventured into software development, diving into web and mobile applications with a focus on React, Node.js, and full-stack technologies. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of building solutions for companies across different sectors, from fintech platforms to enterprise applications, always aiming to deliver efficient, scalable, and user-centric experiences. Fast forward to today, I’ve contributed to projects involving complex frontend architectures, API integrations, and CI/CD automation, while consistently staying up-to-date with the latest tech like TypeScript, Vite, and Ant Design. Whether it's leading migrations or optimizing systems, my goal is to create seamless, robust digital products. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new workout routines, playing football, or diving into the world of technology and learning."
